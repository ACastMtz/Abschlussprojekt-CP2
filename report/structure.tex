%A work breakdown structure (WBS) diagram, is for decomposing a task into smaller parts, which helps organizing and performing. This example diagram shows possible tasks for designing a TikZ diagram. The basis is a tree, nodes were addes below its child nodes. It was originally posted by Gonzalo Medina as TeX.SE (http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/81809/213), modified by Stefan Kottwitz.
